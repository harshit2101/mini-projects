        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, which fall under the command of the government at three levels: Central, state and local. Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India's constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a 'concurrent subject'. </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Transforming the Education system of India</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Major transformations in the system of Indian education had taken place with the emergence of the colonial era in India. The British government introduced the English language and other modern subjects. They introduced a system of classroom and western style of schooling. Hence, the bond between nature and students started fading away. The gurukula system got ban by the colonial government and declared inefficient. As a result, all the ancient methods of teachings vanished with time.

If we look at the present-day education system, it is pretty clear that the syllabus provided is bulky. Lacks practical skills for the students and makes them cramming machines. Emphasis on rote learning is taking place, and no job-oriented skills included in the syllabus. Though there are plenty of graduates in the country, there is such immense unemployment. This is also owing partly to a lack of practical and industry-based knowledge. Overall, it should take into consideration that furthermore transformations are need of the hour in the educational sector.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The recent systematic literature review conducted by Cabral and Dhar (2019)[5] has identified the significance of skill development wherein the implementation of such schemes mitigate poverty, utilize demographic dividend, socio-economic empowerment of under privileged sectors, achieve economic growth, reduce social challenges, and economic inclusion. As far as institutional mechanism is concerned, the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship and the scheme - Prime Minister Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) have resulted to achieve considerable results, but not achieved the expected outcomes.</p>
